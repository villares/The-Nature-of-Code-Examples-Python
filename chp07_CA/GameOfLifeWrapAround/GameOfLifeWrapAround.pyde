# Daniel Shiffman, Nature of Code

# A basic implementation of John Conway's Game of Life CA
# how could this be improved to use object oriented programming?
# think of it as similar to our particle system, with a "cell" class
# to describe each individual cell and a "cellular automata" class
# to describe a collection of cells

# Cells wrap around
